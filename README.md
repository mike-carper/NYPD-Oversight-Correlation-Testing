Police Oversight in New York City: Analyzing Substantiation Rate, Discipline Rate, and Discipline Severity in Misconduct Allegations

NYU CUSP Team: Project Manager Ari Lewenstein, John Paul McKay, Mike Carper and Kah Yoke Ho

I, Mike Carper, contributed to this project as a contributing author and correlation analyst. Posted in this repository is some of the code I wrote for this project. This includes chi-square tests I performed on substantiation rates across four categories of police misconduct as well as KS-tests on discipline severity distributions of these four types using NYCLU police misconduct data. Also included in this repository is the dataset itself for the reference of the public. Continued analysis on this data will only help increase the likelihood of accountability for the NYPD.

The findings of this project revealed that over the last ten years, NYPD Abuse of Force allegations have been substantiated and met with discipline the least frequently of any allegation type by statistically significant margins.
